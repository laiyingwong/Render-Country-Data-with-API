# 🌏 Render Country Data with API

When a user searches for a country, this app will fetch data from an API and display information about the selected country as well as its neighboring country, including population, language and currency.

## ✨ What I Have Learned

This is a code-along project to assist me in learning asynchronous JavaScript, APIs, Promises, and AJAX. Throughout the project, I learned how to retrieve data from an API using XMLHttpRequest() and fetch() methods and how these methods differ from each other. This helps me grasp a good understanding of Promise handlers and chaining, JSON parsing, and how the requests and responses between servers work behind the scenes.
