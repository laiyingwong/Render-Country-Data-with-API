## ✨ What Have I Learned

This is a code-along project to assist me in learning asynchronous JavaScript, APIs, promises, and AJAX. Throughout the project, I gained a good understanding of JSON, XMLHttpRequest, fetch API, and how the requests and responses between servers work behind the scenes.


## 👏 Credits

This project is based on the asynchronous JavaScript tutorial by <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/">Jonas Schmedtmann</a> on Udemy.

API used in the project is <a href="https://restcountries.com/#api-endpoints-v3">REST Countries</a>.
